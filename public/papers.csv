"Why Isn't the Whole World Developed? Lessons from the Cotton Mills","http://faculty.econ.ucdavis.edu/faculty/gclark/210a/readings/clark-why.pdf","Gregory Clark","The Journal of Economic History","History","Development","Results","Motivation","Clark is an incisive, iconoclastic writer and, in his early years as an economic historian, was unafraid to ask big questions and offer controversial answers. Using data on cotton spinning in a range of developed and developing countries in the early 20th century, Clark convincingly rules out capital-labor substitution, technological differences, management, and formal human capital—in short, all the textbook theories of differential development—as explanations for international productivity differences. Few (if any) papers in economic history or development satisfactorily came to grips with the challenge he presents. I've probably thought about this paper more than any other—trying to find some way around his critique, without success.
